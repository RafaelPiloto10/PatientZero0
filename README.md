# Patient Zer0

## TODO:

- Rafael
  - (7/25) Find state economic contribution to US healthcare
  - (7/25) Find more resources/papers to further simulation accuracy
  - (7/26) Improve case prediction model
  - (7/26) US PPE capacity

## Known Bugs:

- Need to optimize simulation & all nested child loops

## Change log:


- (7/27) Implemented Mappa.js to load a map of the United States w/ the ability to use the location information - Diego
- (7/26) Completed elementary virus spread simulation using an exponential function as the model w/ features of keeping track of how many people are infected/recovered/dead- Rafael
- (7/26) Implemented time simulation & started simulating virus spread model - Rafael
- (7/25) Created state data and gathered resources for further review - Rafael
- (7/25) Populated the state & country class with extensive comments and documentation. Updated TODO list & added Resources section in README.md - Rafael
- (7/24) Split classes into separate files to follow OOP practices. Created Game & State class (check index.html for short description). - Rafael
- (7/24) Created basic template - Diego & Rafael
