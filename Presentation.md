[Diego] What did you originally set out to build? Who is it for?

- We set out to build a game to help users understand the importance of protective measures against COVID-19 by visualizing their impact through a simulation where the user has the power to control how the country responds to COVID-19. Our simulation is targeted towards the general population.

[Rafael] What was the hardest part? How did you get past the hardest part?

- The hardest part about the project was trying to simulate nature itself, which is very unpredictable. We wanted to create a simulation that was as accurate as possible while maintaining as much simplicity as possible. So we ended up only including the factors that we observed to have the most impact.

[Diego] How did the project evolve over time as you worked on it?

- Our project started out with a simple virus spread model. We continued to expand our project by adding more visual and comprehendable feedback so that the user could have a better understanding of how the virus is affecting the country. Finally, we added user functionality, so that the user can respond to the virus.

[Rafael] What bugs do you have left that are still "bugging" you?

- Fortunately, after playing debugger so often in our meets, we were able to get rid of any game breaking bugs. Although not a bug, the simplicity of our simulation overlooks a lot of factors of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in some cases can give it odd behavior.

[Diego] If you had more time, what other features / ideas would you add?

- We would like to add more user responses to the pandemic as well as include more real-world factors in the model. The idea of training a machine learning model to this simulation and seeing how the model would respond to the virus is also intriguing.
